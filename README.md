Linear-Quadratic-Regulator-with-KF
==================================
Author: Pranav Bhatkhande
LQR combined with a Kalman Filter, example developed in Simulink/Matlab

Pre-requisites:
* Refer to [my kalman filter repo](https://github.com/pranavbhatkhande/Continuous-Kalman-Filter-Simulink) to understand the usage of the Kalman filter
* Check out repo on how the filter is combined with the regulator to obtain optimal control (a very popular technique!)
